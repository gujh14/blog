- M2D2 is an abbreviation for Molecular Modeling & Drug Discovery. This is a community is co-organized by Valence Discovery and Mila - Quebec AI Institute.
- New presentation comes up every Tuesday via Zoom. Authors of recent papers introduce their work themselves and answers questions. Most of the sessions are recorded and uploaded on Youtube.
- Most papers have been accepted at top conferences.
- Highly recommend to watch those videos.
